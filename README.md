**Defining structure**

*public:*

    index.php: The application's entry point. Receives all requests and redirects them to the appropriate controllers.

    assets: Contains the application's static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).

*app:*

Config: Contains the application's configuration files, such as database settings, routes, etc.
Controllers: Contains the controllers, which are responsible for handling user requests and calling the corresponding models and views.
Models: Contains the models, which represent the application's entities and are responsible for interacting with the database.
Views: Contains the views, which are the templates used to generate the user interface.
helpers: Contains helper functions that can be used anywhere in the application.
tests:

Contains unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
.gitignore:

Contains a list of files and directories to be ignored by Git.
Explanation:

This structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, a common architectural pattern for web applications. It promotes separation of concerns, making the code more organized, maintainable, and testable.

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: Presents the data to the user.
Controller: Handles user input and updates the model, then selects an appropriate view to display.
Additional notes:

Helpers: These are utility functions that can be used throughout the application to perform common tasks, such as formatting data or generating unique IDs.
Tests: Writing tests is crucial for ensuring the quality and correctness of your code. Unit tests test individual units of code, while integration tests test how different parts of the application work together.
.gitignore: This file is used to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when committing changes. This is useful for excluding files that are generated automatically or that should not be tracked in version control.
